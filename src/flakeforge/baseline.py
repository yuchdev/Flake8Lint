"""Baseline fingerprinting, loading, and writing for incremental adoption.

A *baseline* records the fingerprints of violations a project chooses to accept
today so that ``flakeforge`` can suppress them on later runs and fail only on
*new* violations (plan contract C1). This module is deliberately self-contained
and uses the standard library only (plan contract C8): it never imports the
engine, so the api layer orchestrates it without an import cycle.

**Fingerprint (ratified decision D2).** Each violation's fingerprint is::

    sha256(code + US + relative_path + US + normalized_line_text)

where ``US`` is the ASCII unit separator ``\\x1f`` -- an explicit field
separator so that, e.g., code ``X1`` + path ``a`` cannot collide with code ``X``
+ path ``1a``. The three fields are:

* ``code`` -- the rule code (e.g. ``X001``), verbatim.
* ``relative_path`` -- the violation's display filename: POSIX, relative to the
  config ``base_dir`` (plan contract C6), exactly as rendered in output.
* ``normalized_line_text`` -- the source line the violation points at, split on
  universal newlines (so no ``\\r`` or ``\\n`` terminator is ever included) and
  with surrounding ASCII whitespace stripped (:func:`str.strip`, removing
  leading/trailing spaces *and* tabs). Interior text -- including interior tabs
  -- is preserved verbatim. Stripping the ends means re-indenting a line does
  not resurface a baselined violation, while editing the line's content does.

Because a fingerprint hashes the line *text* rather than a line *number*, it
survives inserting or deleting unrelated lines above the violation. Identical
lines (same code, path and text) collide by design, so each fingerprint also
carries an **occurrence index**: the 0-based position of the violation among all
violations sharing that fingerprint, assigned in the deterministic C9 order
(filename, line, column, code, message). Removing one of several identical lines
therefore leaves the remaining occurrences matched and reports the removed one as
fixed.
